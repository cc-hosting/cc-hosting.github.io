                The foundation of my interface and experience design comes from my degree in game development. I have worked with in all aspects of the design pipeline from concept to deployment. I have storyboarded and wireframed my way through to prototypes, taken those prototypes to functioning designs and deployments for games, websites, and applications. My career thus far has wound me around the periphery of design and development, so much so, that I am able to prove that I hit the ground running.
              </p>
              <p>
                My particular approach to most, if not all, of my design is minimalism. While overly visual designs can play an important role, I feel that the heavier an interface is, the more it gets in its own way. I work to make things as simple, clean, and direct as possible for all involved. I aim for this practice to cover the designers and developers making the products as well as the users and customers interfacing with them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cleaner designs yield smoother workflows and easier deliverables.
              </p>

                For this project, I've spent a few hours working up a redesign of the Harris County/Houston Water Bills website. Their current site is...fraught with issues. Sections of the site will work one day but not the next, login attempts will fail endless regardless of browser choice or cache clears. Beyond that, I have simply stopped trying to sign in with my phone. This is just the tip of the iceberg as a number of the houstontx.gov sites all have various security and encryption issues as well. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The below prototype is work to modernize both the site's design and its security. It currently focuses on the user/account portal and as such, I've skimmed down all the various sections into three main elements: a main account dashboard; usage details; contact and support details.
                <ul>
                  <li>Home/Dashboard: provides all pertinent account, usage, and bill-related details on a single page, includes the option to pay the current bill</li>
                  <li>Usage Details: provides detailed water usage and historical records</li>
                  <li>Contact: provides all contact and support-related information broken down into communication methods: Phone, Email, Mail, and Fax</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                The prototype currently lacks database interaction to load user account details (once they've signed in).

                Oh, and since it's built with Bootstrap, it's mobile-friendly and responsive out of the box.

                There is a place where there is no pain. No suffering. No agony. No loss. No transgressions of time. This place is blessed by existence, yet simultaneously cursed by its own weight and importance. It is a weapon. One whose creators destroyed, broke into countless pieces to prevent it from corruption.
                <br><br>
                It was just too powerful. Too beautiful.
                <br><br>
                But...the pieces remain, they float along the rivers and seas of time and space lost, longing to be found. Longing to be reunited. Longing to be whole again.</p>

                    <p>There was a crashing, gnashing, crunching sound, one like branches and rock and home being crumbled asunder by some great, unimaginable weight. The people raised their heads to the skies and saw nothing. They looked within, and saw truth.</p>

                    <p>There was a sensation welling up from deep within. It was an unknown feeling even to the wisest, it was a painful warmness. A foreboding, nameless terror. The people in the streets glanced around in fear, looking for answers on the faces of their neighbors, but none were found. The very universe shuddered around them.
                    <br><br>
                    Men, women, and children all at once were torn apart at the atomic level, rent into nothingness. Their collective consciousness extinguished in the span of their last heartbeat.
                    <br><br>
                    There was nothing left.
                    <br><br>
                    It had to be.</p>
